@book{Bethe1977,
   abstract = {This classic of modern physics includes a vast array of approximation methods, mathematical tricks, and physical pictures that are also useful in the application of quantum mechanics to other fields. Students and professionals will find it an essential reference for calculations pertaining to hydrogen-like and helium-like atoms and their comparison with experimental results. In-depth explorations of the Dirac theory of the electron and of radiative effects include brief accounts of relevant experiments. The specific application of general field-theoretic results to atomic systems also receives a thorough examination. Author Hans A. Bethe (1906–2005), Professor of Physics at Cornell University, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. Co-author Edwin E. Salpeter is James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor of the Physical Sciences at Cornell University.},

@article{Indelicato2011,
   abstract = {We explore QED and many-body effects in super-heavy elements up to Z = 173 using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method. We study the effect of going beyond the average level approximation on the determination of the ground state of element 140 and compare with the recent work of Pekka Pyykkö on the periodic table for super-heavy elements (Pyykkö, in Phys Chem Chem Phys, 13:161, 2011). We confirm that QED corrections are of the order of 1\% on ionization energies. We show that the atomic number at which the 1s shell dives into the negative energy continuum is 173 and is not affected by the approximation employed to evaluate the electron-electron interaction. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Paul2021,
   abstract = {Precision study of few-electron, high-Z ions is a privileged field for probing high-field, bound-state quantum electrodynamics (BSQED). However, the accuracy of such tests is plagued by nuclear uncertainties, which are often larger than the BSQED effects under investigation. We propose an alternative method with exotic atoms and show that transitions may be found between circular Rydberg states where nuclear contributions are vanishing while BSQED effects remain large. When probed with newly available quantum sensing detectors, these systems offer gains in sensitivity of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, while the mean electric field largely exceeds the Schwinger limit.},
