The work performed on this thesis comes as part of the effort to further understand the highly convoluted structure present on Copper's x-ray emission spectra, where, as with many other transition metals, a skewness can be observed on the K$_{\alpha_{1,2}}$, K$_{\beta}$ and L transition lines. These line originate due to the radiative relaxation of the atom's electronic structure post-ionization of inner shell electrons.
However, it is possible that the observed skewness is due to copper's satellite states' transitions.

Throughout this thesis, a study will be performed for the satellite states formed by the excitation of the inner-shell electron, where the ionization process did not occur.

 Multiple atomic structure calculations will be performed using the \textit{ab initio} state of the art \gls{MCDFGME} code for different excited states configurations (from an electron in the $4s$ orbital up to n=??).

 The obtained results will then be used in the analysis of experimental data obtained from a High-Precision \gls{DCS}, located in Paris, in a synchrotron line.

Due to the complexity of the calculations, the process can become quite hefty in terms of computational power and time. Therefore, further similar and more complex studies will be performed by implementing and running a script in the \textit{Oblivion} supercomputer located at the University of Évora.
