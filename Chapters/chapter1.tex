\section{Atomic Structure Calculations}

When studying a system composed of multiple charged bodies, one must consider all the existing interactions. Whilst there are known solutions for the 2-bodies Hydrogenoid systems, with the presence of more non spatially-bound particles (for example an electron, while using the 
Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nuclei are considered at rest at a fixed position) there is just no analytic solution for the Schrödinger Equation. That way, there was a need for the development of numerical solutions able to solve this problem.

\subsection{The non-relativistic Hamiltonian}

The first approach used in order to solve the many-bodies problem used a non-relativistic consideration. This way, the used Hamiltonian consisted on simply the sum of the system's non-relativistic momentum-related energies and the Coulomb interactions between bodies, while still considering the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

Essentially, and in atomic units:

\begin{equation}
    H= \underbrace{\displaystyle\sum_i^N \dfrac{1}{2}\laplacian_i  -\frac{Z}{r_i}}_{\text{Individual Hamiltonian}} + \underbrace{\sum_{i<j}^{j}\dfrac{1}{r_{ij}}}_{\text{Pair repulsion}}
    \label{eq:nonRelHam}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The Hartree-Fock Method}

Hartree developed an iterative method, further enhanced by Fock and Slater,

\subsubsection{Radiative transition type}

One photon transition rates:

Non-relativistic: $dA_{10}=\dfrac{e^2 \omega}{2\pi \hbar c}\abs{\mel**{0}{ \vb*{p\epsilon}^*\cdot\dfrac{1}{m_e c}}{1}}^2$

\subsection{The Dirac Equation}

It is no secret that the Schrödinger equation has some very considerable limitations. The fact that it does not account for the existence of the electron's spin and the lack of consideration of relativistic effects are some of the most impactful setbacks.

That way, a new equation was developed by Paul Dirac, in 1928\cite{Dirac}, one taking into account now not the classical 3 dimensional space components, but the relativistic four components (1 time-like and 3 space-like).

Many scientists, such as Klein, Gordon and later Fock, had already conceived a relativistic correction to Schrödinger's equation, more commonly known as the Klein-Gordon equation\eqref{eq:KG}, where the free-particle energy makes use of the relativistic momentum-energy relation \eqref{eq:EnMomRel}, making Schrödinger's equation now also Lorentz-invariant.
 This new approach was, however, still faulty, due to only describing spin 0 particles (e.g., some mesons), and making use of a second order derivative in the time-like component.

 \begin{equation}
    E=\sqrt{c^2\vb*{p}^2+m^2c^4}
    \label{eq:EnMomRel}
 \end{equation}

Which can be derived from:

 \begin{equation}
    \dfrac{E^2}{c^2}= \vb*{p}^2 +m^2c^2 \Leftrightarrow \dfrac{E^2}{c^2}-\vb*{p}^2=m^2c^2\Leftrightarrow p^\mu p_\mu = m^2c^2
 \end{equation}
 Just as a reminder, since now relativistic effects are being taken into account, the momentum vector is now a 4-vector, composed of one time-like and 3 space-like components: $p^\mu=(p^0.p^1,p^2,p^3)=(p^0,\vb*{p})=\qty(\dfrac{E}{c},\vb*{p})$

 \begin{equation}
    -\hbar^2 \pdv[2]{t} \vb*{\psi}=-c^2\hbar^2\laplacian + m^2c^4\vb*{\psi}
    \label{eq:KG}
\end{equation}

 Dirac took a spin at rewriting the energy-momentum relation, ending up with an equivalent equation\eqref{eq:diracEnergy}, involving $4\times 4$ matrices, due to the 4 relativistic dimensions at play, and incorporating spins into the equation by making use of the now famous Pauli matrices, $\vb*{\sigma}$:

 \begin{equation}
    E=c\vb*{\alpha}\cdot \vb*{p}+{\beta} mc^2,\quad \vb*{\alpha}=\qty(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)
    \label{eq:diracEnergy}
 \end{equation}

 \begin{align}
    \alpha_i&=\mqty(0 & {\sigma}_i\\ {\sigma}_i&0) & {\beta}&=\mqty(I_2 & 0 \\ 0 &-I_2) &I_2&=\mqty(1&0\\0&1)\\
    \sigma_1&=\mqty(0&1\\1&0) & \sigma_2&=\mqty(0&-i\\i&0)& \sigma_3&=\mqty(1&0\\0&-1)
 \end{align}

 In order to fully comprehend this shift of notation, one should equate the square of the two equations, \eqref{eq:EnMomRel} and \eqref{eq:diracEnergy}, and confirm if logic still stands.

 \begin{equation}
    c^2 \vb*{p}^2 + m^2c^4 = c^2\vb*{\alpha}^2\vb*{p}^2+2 m c^3 \vb*{\alpha}\cdot \vb*{p} \cdot \beta + \beta^2 m^2 c^4
 \end{equation}

 In order for this equation to make sense, the following conditions must be true (which in fact, they are):

\begin{gather}
    \begin{cases}
        c^2\vb*{p}^2=c^2\vb*{\alpha}^2 p^2  &\Leftrightarrow \vb*{\alpha}^2=1\\
        0=2mc^3  p \vb*{\alpha} \beta &\Leftrightarrow \vb*{\alpha} \beta =0\\
        m^2c^4=\beta^2 m^2c^4     &\Leftrightarrow \beta^2 =1
    \end{cases}
\end{gather}

As expected, the eigenfunctions obtained from solving this equation, will now have a 4th time-like component, in addition to the already expected 3 space-like components.


With all the previous considerations taken into account, one can now construct Dirac's free-particle equation\eqref{eq:DiracEq}:

\begin{equation}
    i\hbar \pdv{t}\vb*{\psi}=\qty( c\vb*{\alpha}\cdot \vb*{p} +\beta m c^2)\vb*{\psi}=\mqty(mc^2 I_2& -i\hbar c \vb*{\sigma}\cdot \grad\\-i\hbar c \vb*{\sigma}\cdot \grad & -mc^2 I_2)\cdot \mqty(\psi_1\\\vdots\\\psi_4)
    \label{eq:DiracEq}
\end{equation}

This equation, however, as previously mentioned above, can only describe a single particle present in a field-free region. In order to account for the existence of a field, such as the electromagnetic field, derived from the four-potential $A^\mu$, composed by the electric scalar potential, $A^0=\phi$, and the vector potential, $(A^1,A^2,A^3)=\vb*{A}$:


\begin{equation}
    p^\mu \rightarrow p^\mu - e A^\mu,\quad A^\mu = \qty(\phi,\vb*{A})
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian can now be rewritten as to account for the presence of the electromagnetic field \eqref{eq:DiracEqField}. This way it is possible to include, for example, the electron-nucleus Coulomb attraction.

\begin{equation}
    H_D=-e\phi + \beta m c^2 + \vb*{\alpha}\qty(c\vb*{p}+e\vb*{A})
    \label{eq:DiracEqField}
\end{equation}

For a central potential, as is the one generated by the nuclear charge, the 3 space-like components from the four-potential are null, and the time-like component, $\phi=\dfrac{Z e}{r}$. The equation gains now a more recognizable term:

\begin{equation}
    H_D=-\frac{e^2 Z}{r} + \beta m c^2 + \vb*{\alpha}\cdot\vb*{p}c
    \label{eq:diracHam}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Dirac-Breit Equation}

Once again, when considering a system composed of many bodies, one must consider all the present interactions, namely, the electron-electron repulsion in an atom.
 Breit, in 1929, had already created a relativistic approach to treat the electron-electron interactions, consisting on a set of equations building upon the classical non-relativistic Hamiltonian from equation \eqref{eq:nonRelHam}, which can be consulted in appendix \ref{ap:Breit}.
  Breit's equations are able to account for angular momenta couplings and estimate level energy splittings, the change of a particle's apparent mass as a function of velocity, and even include the interaction of an applied magnetic field.\cite{Bethe1977}

  It is quite obvious Breit's equations introduce a great complexity in the search of the new Hamiltonian's eigenfunctions. However, when trying to include Breit's considerations to Dirac's equation, one must add the following operator to the one present in equation \eqref{eq:diracHam}:

  \begin{equation}
    H_B = \sum_{i>j}\frac{e^2}{r_{ij}} - e^2\qty(\frac{\vb*{\alpha}_i\vb*{\alpha}_j}{r_{ij}}+\frac{\qty(\vb*{\alpha}_i \grad_i)\qty(\vb*{\alpha}_j \grad_j)r_{ij}}{2})  
  \end{equation}
