\section{Atomic Structure Calculations}

When studying a system composed of multiple charged bodies, one must consider all the existing interactions. Whilst there are known solutions for the 2-bodies Hydrogenoid systems, with the presence of more non spatially-bound particles (for example an electron, while using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the nuclei are considered at rest at a fixed position) there is just no analytic solution for the Schr√∂dinger Equation. That way, there was a need for the development of numerical solutions able to solve this problem.

\subsection{The non-relativistic Hamiltonian}

The first approach used in order to solve the many-bodies problem used a non-relativistic consideration. This way, the used Hamiltonian consisted on simply the sum of the system's non-relativistic momentum-related energies and the Coulomb interactions between bodies, while still considering the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

Essentially, and in atomic units:

\begin{equation}
    H= \underbrace{\displaystyle\sum_i^N \dfrac{1}{2}\laplacian_i  -\frac{Z}{r_i}}_{\text{Individual Hamiltonian}} + \underbrace{\sum_{i<j}^{j}\dfrac{1}{r_{ij}}}_{\text{Pair repulsion}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The Hartree-Fock Method}

Hartree developed an iterative method, further enhanced by Fock and Slater,

\subsubsection{Radiative transition type}

One photon transition rates:

Non-relativistic: $dA_{10}=\dfrac{e^2 \omega}{2\pi \hbar c}\abs{\bra{0} \vb*{p\epsilon}^*\cdot\dfrac{1}{m_e c}\ket{1}}^2$
