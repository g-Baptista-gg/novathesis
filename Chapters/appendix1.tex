\chapter{The Breit Hamiltonian Equations}\label{ap:Breit}

Note: This equations are valid for the electrons in an atom.


The free particle energy:
\begin{equation}
    \displaystyle H_0=\sum_i^N \frac{p^2}{2m_e}
\end{equation}

The electron-nucleus Coulomb attraction:

\begin{equation}
    \displaystyle H_1 = \sum_i^N -\frac{e^2 Z}{r_i}
\end{equation}

The electron-electron Coulomb repulsion:

\begin{equation}
    H_2 = \displaystyle \sum_{i>j}\frac{e^2}{r_{ij}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    H_3 = -\frac{1}{8 {m_e}^3 c^2}\sum_{i}^{N} p_i^4
\end{equation}
